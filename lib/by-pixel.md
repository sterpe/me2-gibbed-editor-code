### Note

Before I discovered Gibbed Editor, I had painstakingly done a pixel
rendition, by comparing screenshots of my imported character and
the character being built in the character editor.

The result was suprisingly accurate, but obviously not totally
correct.  For historical purposes I record my best by \`eye' effort
here:

```
 743.HDP.NSK.26E.EWA.43F.18K.151.C1C.1B4.6G6.615
```

Compare it with the actual:

```
743.HEP.PTK.16E.EWA.43F.19K.151.C1C.1C4.6G6.615
```


And a side-by-side comparison:

```
         -1    -2 -1    +1                       -1                      -1
          |     | |     |                         |                       |
          v     v v     v                         v                       v
